## Overview

Vaults are similar to filesystems in that they provide a unified directory structure where folders, files, and datasets can be stored. All items in a vault (the folders, files, and datasets) are collectively referred to as "objects". All vault objects can be moved, copied, renamed, tagged, and assigned metadata.

Vaults also have an advanced permission model that provides three different levels of access: read, write, and admin. Vaults can be shared and permissions can be set via the EDP UI; for more information about working with vaults on the web interface as well as vault basics such as vault types, users can refer to the Vaults via UI documentation.


## Creating Vaults

Users can create a vault as long as it has a unique name within their account domain. Vault and object names are case-insensitive. Once users create a vault, they'll be able to add folders, upload files, and create datasets. To be safe, a special method is provided to retrieve the vault by name if it already exists:

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Create a vault by name (only if it doesn't exist)
vault_x <- Vault.get_or_create_by_full_path("Vault X")

# Create a vault (updates the vault if already exists)
vault_x <- Vault_create(name = "Vault X")
```


## Retrieving Vaults

Users can retrieve any shared vault by name or the full path (e.g. domain:name). The only exception is a user's personal vault which has a special name, \~, which is also its full path. If a vault is shared with a user by someone from another organization, it must be retrieved by its full path (e.g. quartzbio:public). Users can also retrieve multiple vaults matching a given advanced search query (e.g. user:username).

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Retrieve your personal vault
my_vault <- Vault.get_personal_vault()

# Your personal vault also has the shortcut `~`
my_vault <- Vault.get_by_full_path("~")

# Retrieve a shared vault by name
vault_x <- Vault.get_by_full_path("Vault X")

# Retrieve a vault from a different domain
public_vault <- Vault.get_by_full_path("quartzbio:public")

# Retrieve a vault by ID
public_vault <- Vault.retrieve("19")

# Retrieve all vaults which match a given Advanced search query
specific_user_vaults <- Vault.all(query = "user:john")
```


## Creating Folders

Folders can only be created within a vault for which the user has write-level permission. Folder names are case-insensitive. If a user attempts to create a folder with a duplicate name, the vault will add an incrementing number to the name (i.e. folder, folder-1, folder-2, ...).

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# First, retrieve the vault
vault <- Vault.get_personal_vault()

# Create the folder at the root of the vault
folder <- Vault.create_folder(vault$id, "/new-folder")
```


## Uploading Files

Users can upload files to any vault to which they have write-level access. File names are case-insensitive. Uploading a file with a duplicate name (or the same name as a folder) will cause the new file's name to be auto-incremented (i.e. file, file-1, file-2, ...).

The max upload size is 5 GB. Users are recommended to gzip their files before uploading if they are large.

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# First retrieve the vault
vault <- Vault.get_personal_vault()

# Upload your file into the root of the vault File_upload
# Object.upload_file('local/path/data.csv', vault$id, '/')
File_upload(vault_id = vault$id, local_path = "local/path/data.csv", vault_path = "/")

# You can also specify a new filename for the uploaded file:
File_upload(vault$id, "local/path/data.tsv", "/data_with_a_description.csv")
```


## Downloading Files

Users can download any existing file from a vault if they have read access to the vault:

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Retrieve an existing file from your personal vault
csv_file <- Object.get_by_full_path("vault:/data.csv")

# Download file
File_download(csv_file$id, "data.csv")

# Get file download URL
url <- File_get_download_url(csv_file$id)
```

Users can also download more than one file in the same folder:

```{r}
files <- Vault.search(vault$id, "xyz", object_type = "file")

for (file in files) {
  File_download(file$id, file$name)
}
```


## Searching within Vaults

Users can search for files, folders, and datasets within any vault by name or other attributes.

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Retrieve a vault
vault <- Vault.get_personal_vault()

# Search across files, folders, and datasets in the vault
objects <- Vault.search(vault$id, query = "xyz")

# Search for a particular object type: file/folder/dataset
files <- Vault.search(vault$id, "xyz", object_type = "file")

# List all datasets in a vault
datasets <- Vault.datasets(vault$id)

# Find all objects matching an exact filename
data_objects <- Vault.objects(vault$id, filename = "data.csv")

# Retrieve the QuartzBio public vault
public <- Vault.get_by_full_path("quartzbio:public")
```


## Advanced Search

Users can list all objects within a vault that match a specific pattern (i.e. find all the files within a certain folder) by providing a case-insensitive regular expression to the regex parameter. It is highly recommended to use Object.search() instead of searching by regular expression, unless it is absolutely necessary.

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Retrieve the EDP public vault
# List all datasets within a specific folder using regex
public <- Vault.get_by_full_path("quartzbio:public")
all_clinvar_datasets <- Vault.datasets(public$id, regex = "/ClinVar/.*")

# List all datasets within a specific folder using regex
all_clinvar_datasets <- Vault.datasets(public$id, regex = "/ClinVar/.*")
```


## Move Files Between Folders

Users can search for files in one folder using the aforementioned querying and move them to another folder.

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Get the vault
vault_x <- Vault.get_or_create_by_full_path("Vault X")
# Create the folder in the vault
new_folder <- Vault.create_folder(vault_x$id, "/new-folder")

# Query current vault for the specific files
files <- Vault.search(vault_x$id, "xyz", object_type = "file")

# Update parent_object_id in order to move the file to the new folder
for (file in files) {
  Object.update(file$id, parent_object_id = new_folder$id)
}
```


## Deleting Vaults and Objects

Users can delete any vault or object (file, folder, or dataset) that they have admin-level permissions on. Deleting a vault or folder will automatically delete all its contents.

```{r}
library(quartzbio.edp)

# Create an empty folder in your personal vault
vault <- Vault.get_personal_vault()
folder <- Vault.create_folder(vault$id, "/test-delete-folder")

# Create the folder at the root of the vault
Object.delete(folder$id)
```


## API Endpoints

Methods do not accept URL parameters or request bodies unless specified. Please note that if your EDP endpoint is sponsor.edp.aws.quartz.bio, you would use sponsor.api.edp.aws.quartz.bio.
