## Dataset Activity

Dataset activity includes any operation that imports, transforms, exports, or copies dataset data. Users can view a dataset's activity via the API or in the EDP UI by visiting the Activity tab of a dataset.

### Example: Check for any Activity

This example is a fast way to check for any activity on a dataset.

```{r}
status <- paste("running", "queued", "pending", sep = ",")
tasks <- Task.all(target_object_id = "<DATASET ID>", status = status, limit = 1)$total
if (tasks) {
  # Active tasks
} else {
  # Dataset is idle
}
```

### Example: Wait for an Idle Dataset

Some use cases may require waiting until a dataset is idle. A dataset is idle when there are no longer any task operations that are queued, pending, or running.

This can be done synchronously using the follow parameter. This parameter continually loops through all dataset activity until the dataset is idle.

The function sleeps for 3 seconds in between each check for activity.

```{r}
Dataset.activity("<DATASET ID>", follow = TRUE)
```

## Reverting Datasets

### Overview

Dataset commits are the backbone of EDP's datastore and represent a change log of modifications to a dataset. A dataset commit represents all changes made to the target dataset by the import/migration/delete process.

All of these changes can be reverted by creating a rollback commit. All commits can be reverted. A rollback commit will restore the dataset to its state before the commit was made.

The parent commit of a rollback commit is the commit to be reverted.

### Rollbacks

A rollback commit represents a revert of a commit. The rollback commit will do different things depending on the mode of the parent commit. It may delete records, index a rollback file, or both.

A rollback file is generated for overwrite, upsert, and delete modes. This file is generated right before records are committed, by querying the current state of the dataset and storing those records in a file. This file is stored with the commit object and used when creating a rollback commit.

| Commit Mode | Description                                                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| append      | Reverts by deleting all records containing parent \_commit ID                                  |
| delete      | Reverts by indexing the records deleted (stored in the rollback file)                          |
| overwrite   | Reverts by deleting all records containing parent \_commit ID. Then indexing the rollback file |
| upsert      | Same as overwriting commit mode                                                                |

### Checking the Ability to Rollback

In order for a commit to be reverted, there must be a clear "commit" stack on the dataset. Commits with mode overwrite or upsert will block reverts and must be reverted first. When creating a rollback, if there are blocking commits, the endpoint will fail and return these blocking commit values.

#### Example

Imagine a simple dataset containing employee names and employee addresses. This is maintained by an annual import of employees with address changes (including new employees.) Over the course of a few years, several employees move addresses. Several employees join the company, and some leave as well.

-   Commit A (Import 2015 address file in overwrite mode)
-   Commit B (Import 2016 address file in overwrite mode)
-   Commit C (Import 2017 address file in overwrite mode)
-   Commit D (Import 2018 address file in overwrite mode)

Let's do a simple case first, where nobody actually moves addresses, and therefore only new employees are added.

If a user were to revert Commit C, then they would only remove new 2017 employees from the dataset. The 2015, 2016, and 2018 employees all remain.

Now let's assume people do move and so each year we have all sorts of address changes.

If users were to revert Commit C, then the dataset would be restored to the known state that it was in Commit B. It would only reset the 2017 addresses to 2016 addresses for people that did not also change in 2018. It would also leave any new employees added in 2018. This is an inconsistent state and not a valid snapshot of the dataset at the time Commit C was indexed. Therefore this is not allowed and attempts to rollback will fail. Commit D must be reverted first.

### Archiving Datasets

#### Overview

Archiving gives users the ability to safely store the datasets that they do not use frequently, without consuming their organization's active storage space quota. When users decide that they want to use the dataset again, they can quickly and easily restore it. Depending on the storage class used, a dataset may be archived automatically.

#### Permissions

A user must have `write` permissions on the vault in order to archive or restore a dataset.

#### Querying

Archived datasets currently cannot be queried and will raise an error if a query is attempted. Users can check if a dataset is archived by checking its `availability` parameter. The value will be `available`, `unavailable`, or `archived`.

#### Examples

Users can easily archive and restore a dataset through the UI or through the API.

#### Archiving

A Dataset can be archived by changing the storage class to "Archive" within the R client.

```{r}
require(quartzbio.edp)

# Set storage class to archive
Object_update("DATASET ID", storage_class = "Archive")
```

#### Restore

Restoring the archived dataset can be done by changing the storage class to "Standard" within the R client.

```{r}
require(quartzbio.edp)

# Restore the dataset by setting the storage class to standard
Object_update("DATASET ID", storage_class = "Standard")
```

#### Switching the Storage Class

Storage classes can be modified from the R client as follows:

```{r}
require(quartzbio.edp)

# Set storage class to archive
Object_update("DATASET ID", storage_class = "Archive")

# Set the storage class to essential
Object_update("DATASET ID", storage_class = "Essential")
```

#### Supporting Archived Datasets

After the introduction of dataset archiving & restoring and of dataset storage classes (December 2020), a dataset may now be in an unavailable state. Scripts and apps must now check for this state before querying or explicitly handling query failures. Both the Dataset and the Object resources now contain the "availability" parameter which returns "available", "unavailable", "restoring" or "archived" for a dataset.

See examples below:

```{r}
# Explicitly check availability
dataset <- Dataset.get_by_full_path("quartzbio:public:/ClinVar/3.7.4-2017-01-30/Variants-GRCh37")
if (dataset$availability != "available") {
  print(paste("Not querying dataset", dataset$id, " with availability:", dataset$availability))
}

# Catch errors
tryCatch(
  print(Dataset.query(id = dataset$id, limit = 10, paginate = TRUE)),
  error = function() {
    print(paste(
      "Unable to query: Dataset", dataset$id, "availability is",
      dataset$availability
    ))
  }
)
```

## API Endpoints

Methods do not accept URL parameters or request bodies unless specified. Please note that if your EDP endpoint is sponsor.edp.aws.quartz.bio, you would use sponsor.api.edp.aws.quartz.bio.

### Dataset Commits

Dataset commits cannot be directly created. Commits are generated only from dataset imports.
